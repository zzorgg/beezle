<!-- Foreground reverted to <inset> for consistent padding-based sizing.
     Adjust the inset values (uniform or per-side) to fine-tune how large the bee appears.
     Suggested reference points (uniform inset):
       8dp  = quite large (near edges)
       10dp = prominent
       12dp = balanced (current)
       14dp = more breathing room
     Change android:inset="12dp" below if you want a different look. -->
